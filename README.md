## Machine Learning Library
This library was developed during the "Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition" course at PoliTO during the accademic year 2021/2022. 

In Classifier.py you can find the implementations of the following shallow learning models :
- Gaussian Model (Naive and/or Tied assumption)
- (Quadratic) Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (Linear, Polynomial and RBF kernels)
- Gaussian Mixture Model (Naive and/or Tied assumption)

In preprocessing.py there are the implementations of some PP technique:
- PCA
- LDA
- Gaussianization
- Z-Score / Z-Normalization

In validation.py there are some helpful functions that you can use to plot graphs such as:
- DET curve 
- ROC curve
- Bayes Error
- Data Histograms
- Correlation Heatmap

In the same file, there is something that you can use to deal with the K-Fold protocol or with the Single Split one.

The __init__.py and __eval__.py can be used as template to start to be confident with the APIs. 

## Extra
In the data folder you can find the training and the test data used to develop the report assignment.
